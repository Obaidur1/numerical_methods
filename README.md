# Numerical Methods Math Problem Solutions

Welcome to my repository of numerical methods math problem solutions! In this repository, you will find C++ code that solves a variety of mathematical problems using different numerical methods.

## Problem List

Here are the numerical methods and corresponding mathematical problems that I have solved in this repository:

- Bisection Method: Find the root of a given function in a given interval.
- False Position Method: Find the root of a given function in a given interval.
- Newton-Raphson Method: Find the root of a given function using an initial guess.
- Secant Method: Find the root of a given function using two initial guesses.
- Simpson 1/3 Rule: Approximate the definite integral of a given function using Simpson's 1/3 rule.
- Trapezoidal Method: Approximate the definite integral of a given function using the trapezoidal rule.

## How to Use

To use any of the numerical methods, simply open the corresponding `.cpp` file in your favorite C++ compiler and run it. You can modify the input values (such as the function to solve, the initial guesses, and the interval) to solve different problems.

## Contributing
